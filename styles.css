/* I feel like we talked about this but not sure. Is it a good practice to make define so broad a class with the body attribute? I feel like you would want the page to be consistent but any changes outside of the "standard" text would need to be declared in a class now. I'll keep it this way but this is a note for when we speak next.*/

/*Not sure how "smart" HTML and CSS are, but can the boxes be dynamically adjusted to its contents (i.e., it grows or shrinks (height specifically, but other dimensions as well) as the content changes) or is it something that always has to be adjusted? My assumption is it's the latter but there may be an easier way than just changing the pixel value over and over again until it fits.*/
