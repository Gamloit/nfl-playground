  <h1 class="moar-title"> My coding journey </h1>

  <p class="main-content"> Depending on how you look at it, I have either been coding for a long time or a very short time. I personally take the latter view. I've been somewhat interested in coding and programming for quite a while but I've always given up. </p>

  <p> <em>While it may appear that I'm just baring my soul here, I'm attempting to get used writing HTML and this is a bit therapeutic, so please bear with me.</em> </p>

  <p>I find coding and programming to be a bit of an <strong>odd</strong> beast. The simple stuff, such as what is displayed on this page, is rather easy. Anyone can start it up and think "Hey, I got this!" But the further you go, the harder it gets. I'm sure there's a plataeu eventually but I have no idea when I will reach that.</p>

  <p class="box">Maybe it's just <u>me</u> but programming seems to be something that actually gets a bit more difficult as it goes. Sure, some things get easier but as of <time datetime="2020-12-10T10:00:00">10:00</time> today it's not really doing that. Not that I really expected it to but I had to find an excuse to use the time element. </p>




<!-- Just putting a note here to remind myself that the <p> tag closes automatically if another block element is introduced, such as <address>. Couldn't figure out why my closing </p> tag was throwing up an error -->

<!-- But I'm not sure why a line break is being put on the email address. Investigating...
EDIT: seems to be related to the address being a block element better suited for footers of the page. To be inline, only the anchor tag is needed.
